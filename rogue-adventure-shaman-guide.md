# Rogue Adventure - Shaman Guide

## Introduction

Shaman is a class you unlock after reaching level 16, you will probably have played other classes a little before him.
For guides about other classes I invite you to check https://gist.github.com/adufilie/d9f42d6fbc7fe5dc1f7874e8f4f35572 for a great warrior guide by @fooblizoo and for a wizard guide by me.

Shaman can be a hard class to understand at first because there is no clear strategy to play it. However it is a very powerful class early if you play it right and it can get really strong.
Your ability lets you stack thunder or fire points everytime you play a card and release them with the totems. Unlike wizard or necromancer, once released you lose your stack
(less so with class upgrade) so you have to build it again everytime. Even so, this ability deals a lot of damage and shaman is a class that can get huge burn stacks that can do all the killing. Your deck should be mostly focused on defense.

Shaman has many options when it comes to building its deck. You can focus on magic or combat cards, or do a mix of both. From inferno 1 to 10, you can focus on inflicting burns or just using the thunder damage but in higher infernos only the burns will let you kill high HP enemies.
As for any class, World 1 will become the most difficult part of the run, because you need to improve your deck quickly before first elite and then to defeat *Gorilla King* or *Evil Forest Guardian*.
You will lose some runs early simply because you didn't find any good cards. Don't feel too bad about it.

### Purpose of this Guide

This guide aims to help both beginners in low infernos (1-10) and advanced players in high infernos (20+). Some advice applies for both and some is more specific.
This guide is any game mode, the first part is meant for classic and should apply to hell which is quite similar. And the last part is about what is different in void mode.
Finally I do not take into account when the cards are unlocked, if you haven't all the cards unlocked yet (level 30) you can read this guide and try with the cards available to you, but I strongly recommend trying stuff by yourself to learn which cards are good, which ones are bad and which ones synergies well together.

## Some important tricks to know

When starting a run, you can pick the map you want while keeping your starting bonus. Before you pick your starting bonus, try looking in the background to see if it's the map you want. If not, kill the app and re-open it, then start a new run instead of continuing. Your starting bonus will still be offered in the new run.
On very high Infernos (30+) this is a must, as you likely won't be able to survive two consecutive battles before the first Merchant.
There is one map which has a Merchant after the first fight.

You can restart a fight. Quit from the menu and select continue to restart the fight from the beginning.
Do this if you make a critical error or an important random outcome is not favorable.
*Key of the Portal* (Skill) protects you from a bad starting hand. Combine with the restart fight trick above to get the best results.
Besides *Key of the Portal*, there are other ways to alter the outcome of your first few turns. Although the starting hand and starting deck order for a fight is fixed, there are a few cards which produce random outcomes that can be optimized by restarting the fight. Some examples: *Old Jester*, *Cthool Acolyte*, *Cthool Apprentice*.
*Night Fairy [FAIRY]* shuffles your deck, so you could play *Night Fairy [FAIRY]* during your first turn just to escape a bad opening shuffle.
Similarly, if you can run through your cards once and trigger a new shuffle, you may restart the fight if you find that the second shuffle isn't so good.

## Description of abilities:

You have a thunder form and a fire form. Playing the totem of the other form will make you change form. Every time you play a card you gain 1 thunder or fire point depending
on your current form, changing form will reset counter to 0 and release 8 damage to a random enemy per thunder point or 3 burns to all enemies per fire point.
Note that the totem card played will count as first card played in the new form, so the counter will be at one after changing form. The thunder damage is unaffected by strength, double damage or weak, and doesn't count as a hit one enemies with backfire damage.

**Class upgrade**: After changing form you keep half the points from the previous form. It is rounded down but you will get your extra point from the totem. 5 points will become 2, then 3 with the totem. 2 will become 1, then 2 again with the totem, so switching form every card played will result in double points compared to without class upgrade, but switching rarely will result more in +50% points.

**Base deck**:

2x *Mage* : deal 3 damage, apply 3 weak

3x *Fire totem* : gain 3 shields, if in thunder form switch to fire form

3x *Thunder totem* : gain 3 shields, if in fire form switch to thunder form


## Class bonus

Every class unlocks a new class bonus after inferno 2, 5 and 10.

**Class bonus 1** - Thunder points will deal 8 damage to all enemies instead of one random. Beware that this changes thunder damage to be affected by double damage, weak, dark grasp and to trigger rockhorn, electric jellyfish or sapphire drake. This class bonus is very good in early infernos (I1-10) but it gets obsolete once enemies start having too much HP.

**Class bonus 2** - Fire points will apply 6 burns to all enemies instead of 3. This is the best bonus for very high infernos (I30+) beacause the burns will be your main source of damage. You can also use it early but it might not be as good as the others.

**Class bonus 3** - Heal 2 hp every time you change form. Once unlocked this is the best class bonus up to I30 or so. It will help you recover and synergies pretty well with the class upgrade and dark sigil.

All shaman class bonuses are nice and despite my advice you can play with whatever you find most fun. However on very high infernos the second one will be best because enemies have too much HP to be killed with thunder and they deal too much damage to recover it with class bonus 3.
This is also because you will want to use cards like *Melgaroth[ANCIENT][DEMON]* that synergies with burns.

## Starting bonus

You get a starting bonus after every time you've completed first world. You don't have to use a starting bonus but it helps. If you lose in World 1, play a different class or inferno level to beat the first Boss and earn your next starting bonus. If you're trying to advance other classes at the same time, you can take this as an opportunity to alternate between them and shaman. If you want the starting bonus ASAP, pick Barbarian or Ranger, choose Normal difficulty, and you can beat World 1 in one to two minutes.
You can quit immediately after defeating the Boss, on the rewards screen. (You can also use Shaman with 1st class bonus on Normal, but switching class bonuses isn't a great idea)
That said, in high infernos you will restart a lot and taking time to get the starting bonus isn't always worth it. You can also just restart enough until you get some good rewards and shops.

**2 Gems** - Never pick this. 100 Coins is worth more.

**100 Coins** - This is the consistency choice, I recommend it up to I30, if you want you can keep using it until I49 where rare card or skill is necessary to win first fight.

**Random Rare** - This is probably your best option past I49. There are a few nice starting bonuses that will help you, but the very best is *Melgaroth, Keeper of Flames [ANCIENT][DEMON]* which can bring you up to I105 on 2nd class bonus.
However you might end up with a useless card most of the time, wasting your starting bonus, which is why I recommend it only once first fight becomes impossible.

**Random Skill** - You can try your luck here, but there are a lot of skills. Most of the time you will get something barely useful if not completely useless. However it can be nice if you want a little help in the run and they're almost never bad.
The theoretical max inferno for shaman is I121 and you can only do it with *Dark Sigil* and 3rd class bonus. But because you are very unlikely to get it and you will probably die before you find some healing, you should do this only past I105 when it's your only chance of survival.

If you are interested in theoretical limits and records, you can check https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18iEOCVwMW5eJfRHM1KzpZFG6p_egl5-_/edit?rtpof=true. Just say ask @Gerr for access. You can contact him on discord. 

## Picking your path

To maximize your chances of survival, you want a path that gives you the most Merchants and Chests, and the least Elites.
In world 1, you will want a Merchant early to prepare for the rest of the world, and one close to the Boss so you can use all the Coins you've accumulated so far to prepare for the Boss fight.
In other worlds you can afford to wait a little longer for the first market.

## General deck strategy

**Mana** - Every deck benefits from getting extra Mana each turn, but even more so for shaman since your damage comes from number of cards played. You have a lot of options, the best card early are *Souls Priestess* or *Souls Guardian*, but you can also use *Wizard III* or even *Lady of the Knight* if you have a combat card related deck. These cards give overcharge so you will want only one, but there are other cards that you can use *Sou, the blade of wind* or *V01-B01 [ROBOT]*.

**Defense first** - Build up your defense quickly or you will likely lose. Don't get too many attack cards. Look for cards with immune or daze like *Snow queen* or *Medusa [BEASTMAN]*. These are the best to defend first turn before you setup your deck. You want to make sure you can draw one of them on turn 1, which is where you are most vulnerable.
These cards exile so you will also want a permanent shield cards with multiplying effect like *Apprentice Guard* or *Alestar, the tranquility defender [ANCIENT]*. Another option for defense is *Melgaroth, the Keeper of Flames [ANCIENT][DEMON]* which can turn burns into shields.
Try to get to a point where you are not losing any HP.

**Permanent buffs** - Strength doesn't benefit shaman, but favor resistance buffs that last until the end of the fight instead of temporary end-of-turn buffs. *Blue witch*, *Sigil essence*, *Dhorion* and *Wizard of Nature* are the best cards for this.

**Card type** - You can use any card type as shaman, but focusing on magic cards will make *blue witch* and *Elder fairy [FAIRY]* better whereas focusing on combat cards will make *Lady of the Knight* and *Dark shielded knight* better. Keep that in mind when building your deck. Depending on the run, you might want some cards more than others.

**Shaman Points** - Before you get class upgrade you will lose all your points by changing form. If you're focusing on burns you will want to release them by changing to thunder, then go back ASAP to fire form to start stacking fire points again. Burns will deal more damage in a long fight but thunder damage is better to finish off the enemy. Even with 2nd class bonus you will want to stack some thunder in the last turn to kill before they attack (burn is applied after the enemy's attack). 
Try to time the releases according to needs. Releasing burns every turn will mean you stack fewer fire points, you might want to hold onto them until 2nd turn and then release them. 

**Small deck** - A smaller deck will be more consistent. When your deck grows to about 12 cards or more, it becomes unlikely that you will see key cards each turn, unless you have ways to cycle through your deck faster. It also makes you less likely to draw an immune card on turn 1. On the other hand, a 4 card deck means every card you play comes right back in your hand. Note that you must always have at least 6 cards in your deck, but if 2 of them exile or remove, then you're left with a 4 card core.

## What reward to take after a fight

Most of the time you should be taking 1 Gem after a fight, unless you see a card that you would have bought anyway or one you know works well with your chosen strategy.
Don't take random cards just because they are free, because they can clog up your hand and make it harder to win.
Even if you see a card that would be good for late game, you may not want to take it early. For early game, prioritize cards that will help you survive.

## What to do at the Merchant

**Melgaroth** - In low infernos this card isn't necessary, specially without 2nd class bonus. But on higher infernos it's a must. Whenever you find that card you should buy it (one copy is enough). If you have enough money it is worth rerolling cards in every merchant until you find it.

**Heal** - When your HP is low and your defense is not well developed yet, I recommend healing at the Merchant rather than buying a card that will heal you slowly.
If you're HP is still over 50% and you think you can survive until the next Merchant, you don't need to heal.

**Thin your deck** - Your starting deck includes many duplicates which will get in the way of the ther good cards you will add to your deck.
I recommend Removing or Transforming at least one of each in first two worlds. If you have enough money for both, start by transforming one so you can remove the new card after if it's bad.
The *Mage* is pretty bad and you should remove the last one once you find a better option for weak (that weakens all enemies at once).
If you have the money and *circular shield* skill, you might want to remove the last duplicates of your totems to get down to a 4 card deck and get plenty of shields form your skill. However always keeps at least one of each or you won't be able to use your ability anymore.

**Upgrade the class skill** - The class skill is nice but not necessary, priority goes to removing one base card of each type and other good defense cards. You will usually upgrade it in world 3 or 4 but you can finish the run without it.

**Duplicating** - If you have a very good card like *Elder fairy [FAIRY]* you might want to duplicate it for 300 gold in merchant, I recommend this once the rest of your deck is good enough and you just want that extra preparation time in battle.

**Consider trading Gems for Coins** - Once you have 4 Gems, you will be able to trade them for 100 Coins, so keep that in mind when looking at card prices.
Similarly, when you have 7 Gems you can afford the *Gold Ingot* skill which gives 300 Coins.

**Spend wisely** - If you don't see any good options and you think you can survive until the next Merchant, save your Coins and Gems. If the next Merchant is 2 or 3 fights away and you think you need to prepare for those, don't be afraid to Reroll cards or skills if you can afford something nice that could show up.

## General good cards:

### Overcharged mana card (1)
- *Wizard I*, bad mana early but highest mana giver if you can set it up
- *Sapphire guard*, mana isn't great but it also gives shield, decent option before you get one of the above, but you still want another overcharged mana card. It can synergies with *Lady of the Knight* for a combat card focused deck.
- *Young witch*, gives a lot of mana but exiles so can only be used once

- *Souls priestess*, best option for early mana and searching through the deck
- *Souls guardian*, good mana early
- *Lady of the Knight*, good mana if deck focused on combat card

### Other mana cards
- *Old jester*, free to play, exiles and can search for a rare card
- *Spirit of magic I [ANCIENT]*, free to play early and deals weak, still good once upgraded but no longer a free mana card, also is ancient
- *Spirit of defense I [ANCIENT]*, free to play early and a little defense, pretty bad once upgraded though, only take early for a little help or if ancient build
- *Fairy princess [FAIRY]*, not free to pley but gives other free cards and exiles, decent for early fight and gives some healing

- *Sou, the blade of wind [ANCIENT]*, gives good mana if played first, good option all game long unless you are going for a 4 card *circular shield* deck, also is ancient
- *Moon fairy [FAIRY]*, free mana card and search option
- *High priest*, free mana card but bad search option
- *Magic leaf*, activation is free, can give decent shield and can also be used as weak option even though it doesn't affect all enemies. It can transition into a *dark sigil* first turn kill deck too

- *V01-B01 [ROBOT]*, gives mana without having to be played but doesn't work if overcharged (not great with *Souls priestess/guardian*), resistance is decent too
- *Elder fairy [FAIRY]*, great setup card, removes so can only be used once, worth duplicating.

### Weak (1)
- *Spirit of magic I [ANCIENT]*, great for weak and mana early, great for weak on all enemies once upgraded, best option
- *High witch I*, once upgraded exiles and deals enough weak for the whole fight, frees up space in the deck
- *Forgotten priestess*, not a lot of weak but its on all enemies and protects you from block, frail, wound and sometimes curse, but not silence unfortunately

- *Keyra, the Shy Soul [ANCIENT]*, doesn't give a lot of weak but is ancient and can give shields
- *Necromancer acolyte*, give a litle more weak, damage is pointless but curse can be annoying

### Resistance
- *Blue witch*, can give 4 res, incredible on magic focused deck and still decent otherwise
- *Sigil essence*, 2 res and immune, very good option
- *Sun priestess*, gives 2 res but has bad synergy with demons (*Melgaroth*) so usually avoid it 

- *Druid of the high elves*, mana cost is pretty high but gives 2 res and immune ultimately
- *Dhorion, the holy Sentienl [ANCIENT]*, gives 1 res at the end of every turn if played right, plus armor. Little slow but combined with first turn protection (immune, daze, skills) it's the best resistance option
- *Wizard of Nature*, doubles the res, only take it if you already have other means of getting some res
- *Gorgrirath [DEMON]*, converts burns to temporary res, combine it with *Wizard of Nature* to make it permanent or with armor to use it to get high shields that you will keep for other turns

### Shields
- *Apprentice guard*, great scaling shield effect when combined with some resistance and extra mana
- *Demon guard [DEMON]*, can give you good shields on a demon deck, since you will be going for *Melgaroth* anyway, and if played first you won't lose hp. 

- *Alestar, the Tranquility Defender [ANCIENT]*, good shield value if you have some res and ancients, synergies well with all the other ancients you want anyway. Also doesn't need to be played so counts as an extra card, and can be used for shield bash with some armor. You can get multiple copies of this one.
- *Dark shielded knight*, good shield value even without res if you have a combat card related deck
- *Cthool Acolyte*, good flat shield value and thins the deck, annoying late game though

- *Melgaroth, the Keeper of Flames [ANCIENT][DEMON]*, converts burns to shields, you lose your burns for offense but it gives plenty of shields, particularily with 2nd class bonus
- *Ambassadress of peace*, good flat shield value and useful armor, less good in high inferno, not worth buying

### Armor
- *Iron colossus [ROBOT]*, gives a little armor but not enough by itself, can be coupled with *Dhorion*

- *Dhorion, the Holy Sentinel [ANCIENT]*, gives unlimited armor if you can get it in your hand at the end of every turn. Small deck helps, and can be coupled with another card/skill giving little armor in case you miss it at the end of one turn. It's also ancient and gives plenty of res.
- *Robowitch [ROBOT]*, gives enough armor for the entire fight most of the time, but it can be useful to have a little more
- *Ambassadress of peace*, not a lot of armor but it can be coupled with *Dhorion*

### Immune/daze
- *Earth seed I*, bad card before quest is completed, but great daze card after. nly take it if you can complete the quest, *Melgaroth* makes the quest easy to complete.

- *Snow queen*, great immune card
- *Sigil essence*, immune, empty pile requirement can be annoying but you should have a small deck anyway. Res is very good too
- *Medusa [BEASTMAN] I*, good daze card before the quest, even better if you complete the quest but it's unlikely to have poison as shaman
- *Xatior, order of the wizards*, good daze card, removes instead of exiling so you can't take it back with *Azahr, the Exiled Wizard [ANCIENT]*, *Cthool, the Darkmaster [ANCIENT]*, or *The Timeshifter [ANGEL]*. Once you have it you can go for *Ixar, order of the wizards* for the combo, but keep your deck small to be able to pull it off

- *Druid of the High Elves*, mana cost is pretty high but it gives the immune as well as res and small healing

### Heal
- *Fairy princess [FAIRY]*, gives small healing as well as free mana cards

- *Seeker of the light*, good healing, protection from debuffs (including silence), it takes space in your deck but can provide unlimited healing if you have the mana to do so

- *Druid of the High Elves*, you want it for res and immune but there is small healing
- *Nephil [ANGEL]*, gives fast healing if you go below 50% hp, damage is decent early but otherwise you won't be playing it
- *Ultron [ROBOT]*, decent damage early when at low hp, also gives a free magic card with little healing, gets obsolete pretty fast and not worth spending gold on, but decent starting bonus

### Damage
- *Melgaroth, the Keeper of Flames [ANCIENT][DEMON]*, doubles the burn when in your hand, and gives a shield option. Very powerful and interesting card, specially with 2nd class bonus. It can even be used for a shield bash strategy with some armor. Works best on small decks
- *Beast emperor [BEASTMAN]*, doubles damage from thunder points if you have 1st class bonus

### Money
- *Mage thief*, gives gold, it's very useful once you know you can afford to waste some turns in your fight (usually mid game), it's great to get rid of the base deck or duplicate *elder fairy [FAIRY]*

### Bringing back exile
- *Guardian of heavens [ANGEL]*, can get you a blue witch or immune back from exile, a bit slow but could be worth it

- *Cthool, the Darkmaster [ANCIENT]*, this card duplicates any exile card you play, if you have *snow queen* or *Earth seed II*, you can play it every turn and be untouchable
- *Azahr, the Exiled Wizard [ANCIENT]*, this card duplicates a card from your exile twice, if you played 4 cards already (with some extra mana) you keep it in your deck and have an infinite cycle of immunes or daze. It's also great without staying in your deck, duplicating an exiled card twice is enough.
- *The Timeshifter [ANGEL]*, gets all your exile cards back, can be great but there's often some cards you don't want to play again and it makes the mana cost pretty high


## General good skills:

- *Invisibility potion* (5 gems), good and cheap first turn protection
- *Ice block* (7 gems), good protection that can be save for crucial moment
- *Demon eye* (7 gems), extra mana at the cost of blind, learn enemy patterns and blind is no longer a problem
- *Gold ingot* (7 gems), 300 gold is a lot you can upgrade, buy a rare card or duplicate a card with that. You can also buy multiple cheaper stuff
- *Circular shield* (8 gems), great source of shield with a small deck, with 8 cards it's 10 shield per turn after 1st turn, with 4 cards it's 10 shields per card played
- *Book of magic* (8 gems), great healing once you have extra mana and magic card focused deck
- *Piece of coal* (8 gems), 2 resistance is good for defense, you can restart the fight to get different debuffs until you get weak and blind (sometimes block is fine too)
- *Frost nova* (9 gems), great first turn protection, essentially gives you a free turn at the start of the fight, also avoids many first turn enemy spawns
- *Key of the portal* (9 gems), 1 extra mana on first turn and reshuffle option, very good for consistency and setup
- *Freezing shot* (9 gems), once you have spheres and some mana generation you can daze an enemy almost every turn, single enemies don't stand a chance
- *Necronomicon* (9 gems), extra mana at the cost of hp, do not take too early if you can't block attacks with immunes or shields yet, but great skill mid game
- *Dark sigil* (11 gems), most powerful and dangerous skill, go to skill with 3rd class bonus, otherwise only take it if your deck has enough healing
- *Mana battery* (12 gems), bit expensive early but allows you to save mana for important turns, opens up a very different playstyle. It's great to get tons of gold with mage thief if you gave lots of shields and armored

## Other useful skills:

- *Telescope* (5 gems), cheap and effective, you can plan your path to get hard fights right after market, still a bit inconsistent
- *Torch* (5 gems), cheap skill and helps you get better rewards after fights
- *Snail shell* (6 gems), little armor to combine with *Dhorion*
- *Purple potion* (7 gems), decent if you have *demon eye* already, it's a sure 1 str/res every turn but the first, plus some extra when receiving debuffs
- *Rabbit paw* (8 gems), not a priority but once your deck is well rounded, curse is one of the things that can still kill you. I often take it right before final boss.
- *Phantom spear* (8 gems), deals a lot of damage but you usually don't need it, still much better than *dark sword* which is a waste of gems.
- *Book of resistance* (8 gems), 1 resistance is decent but not great for 8 gems
- *Stone skin* (8 gems), on high inferno you might be often below 50% HP, specially early, so 3 resistance is very good
- *Scorpion claw* (9 gems), expensive for what it is, but once your deck is well rounded you can take it for safety, *rabbit paw* is better
- *Darkness boots* (9 gems), good shields on low inferno against multiple enemies but a bit expensive for what it is
- *Blessing of sanctuary* (10 gems), good once your deck is well rounded and you're afraid of a mistake, for example when you have *demon eye* (if you trigger it then restart the fight, you get it back)
- *Phoenix feather* (10 gems), same as above, slightly worse in my opinion
- *Phantom boots* (13 gems), allows you to avoid almost every elite and go for plenty of chests/merchants, bit expensive and you still have to fight bosses but overall makes the game easy
- *Tear of godess* (15 gems), very expensive skill but saves you from the block/silence nightmare, only once your deck is well rounded

## Attack Strategies

Try to focus on a single attack strategy. If you have too many attack cards, your deck becomes incoherent and you may not have enough defense. Make sure you build up your defense first before committing too many cards to offense. That said don't decide before the run, wait to see what cards you are offered and what you can make of them.

## Attack Strategy: Energy golem with fairy spawns

**+** Quick power up during the fight

**-** Vulnerable in first turns, hard to get going early game

As I said before, *energy golem* is your main source of damage as wizard. Since it doesn't benefit from any buffs like strength or double damage, the only way to power him up is to play many magic cards. Fairy spawns are good for that since they put many free mana magic cards in your deck. You will have no use for strength but you might want resistance for defense. *Blue bloom [FAIRY]* and *Blessed Fairy [FAIRY][ANGEL]* are very good because their spawns give shields which will help you defend while you power up *energy golem*.

You might want a source of armored like *Robowitch [ROBOT]* to keep the shields generated by the spawns, because you are likely to use them all in a single turn and have a lot of overflow shields.
Most of the fairy spawn cards give more cards based on number of fairies in your deck. So you might want to take a couple other fairy cards, but be careful not to take bad ones.

You will eventually run out of spawn cards and will have to finish the fight without them. *Energy golem* will do all the damage but you need a good defense card. *Apprentice guard* is always a good option for wizard but with the fairy spawn strategy, your fairy race counter lets you use *fairy warrior [FAIRY]*, *lullyp [BEASTMAN][FAIRY]* or *mystic bird* as scaling defense cards.

Important to know about this strategy is that it is slow, playing all the fairy spawn cards takes time at the beginning of the fight and leaves you vulnerable.
You can use *elder fairy [FAIRY]* to get extra mana to play all the fairy spawns, you can use immune to protect your self while doing so, and finally once you have enough fairy spawns you can take *dark sigil*. This will let you play all your magic cards for 2 HP instead of mana. Since most spawns heal 3 under 50% HP, you will be able to maintain HP while playing all your spawns. But be very careful not to die before you get to them or once you've played them all and don't have any healing left.
For that you can use skills like *Book of magic* which heals half of the HP loss, or *Nephil [ANGEL]* who heals you 6 HP when below 50%.

### Fairy spawn cards:

- *Fairy princess [FAIRY]*, doesn't rely on number of fairies but number of magic cards in hand, very good early
- *Red bloom [FAIRY]*, not great but is a fairy spawn, poison can let you complete quest for *Medusa [BEASTMAN]*
- *Blue bloom [FAIRY]*, good because gives shield
- *Blessed Fairy [FAIRY][ANGEL]*, good because attacks, shields and heals, but it depends on number of angels.

### Other good fairy cards:

- *Moon fairy [FAIRY]*, very good regardless of fairy synergy, free magic card and helps search for a specific card
- *Elder fairy [FAIRY]*, very good for the mana, once it removes it doesn't count as a fairy in your deck anymore but still great card
- *Fairy queen I [FAIRY]*, good card once the quest is completed, you can afford to take it in low inferno but at some point you won't have time to complete the quest
- *Fairy Warrior [FAIRY]* or *Lullyp [BEASTMAN][FAIRY]*, scaling attack and shield base on number of fairies, take only one as they are combat cards and don't exile. It's one of your defensive option.
- *Night Fairy [FAIRY]*, this card lets you reshuffle your deck and grab all the fairy spawns in your exile immediately, very good if you have *dark sigil* and want them for healing before you cycle through your whole deck. As it doesn't exile, it can get annoying in your deck but it's alright. Beware you might not want the overcharge which will make the spawns not free anymore, so be careful to have another race in your deck.

### Other good cards:

- *Mystic bird*, although not a fairy, he scales with fairies like *Fairy Warrior [FAIRY]* and *Lullyp [BEASTMAN][FAIRY]*. The nice thing is that he is a magic card and not combat, he also attacks every enemy but that's not very important here as it won't be your main source of damage.
- *The Timeshifter [ANGEL]*, can get all your fairy spawns back from exile for a second round. Since you get both the spanwner and the spawnees, it's like getting triple the amount of spawns

### Specific skills:

- *Shield of shadows* (6 gems), basically 3 shields per spawn card, that's quite a lot
- *Solid shell* (7 gems), decent shields but more expensive than *shield of shadows* and less shields
- *Fairy doll* (8 gems), gives you an exile card counting for 3 fairies, not the best skill but decent
- *Dark sigil* (11 gems), as I said before fairy spawns help you maintain HP and *dark sigil* helps you play all the spawns on turn 1. Game changing skill, usually a sure win once you've secured hp recovery
- *Opal stone* (18 gems), expensive but counts as 2 fairies for free, the 2 angels can be good for *Blessed Fairy [FAIRY][ANGEL]* too. Keep in mind that you get 2 demons on the counter so *sun priestess* will give you debuff.

**Advice** : very good strategy in low infernos where first fight are easy enough to let you get your deck started. In higher infernos, only do it if you find cards like *Fairy princess [FAIRY]*, *Moon fairy [FAIRY]* and *elder fairy [FAIRY]* first, which are good anyway, before committing to too many fairy spawns.

**Alternative** : get some strength and you can kill enemies with the spawns from *Blessed Fairy [FAIRY][ANGEL]* if you have enough fairies and angels in your deck. Even if it isn't enough to commplete the kill you can use *fairy warrior [FAIRY]*, *Lullyp [BEASTMAN][FAIRY]* or *mystic bird* to finish the kill. You can use the skill *Phantom spear* for extra damage and if you have *dark sigil* you might consider taking *Devil's Dead* (11 gems) to get crazy strength and finish quick. Take it only after *dark sigil*.

## Attack strategy: Energy golem alone

**+** small deck, very consistent

**-** requires specific cards and a lot of money to remove

Another idea is to not use fairy spawns, focus on defense and use *energy golem* to power up itself. If you can get to a 4 card deck you can play *energy golem* over and over.
For this strategy you don't want too many non exile cards, since you ideally want a 4 card deck. The only shield card worth taking is *apprentice guard* and it's a must. You want *wizard III* too so you're left with one available slot. Here are my preferred choices:
- *mud golem*, this means one less card to remove and you can still use it for weak or as a shield option when blocked
- *seeker of the light*, protects you from silence mostly but also curse and can recover small hp loss (wound, skeletons)
- *magic leaf*, can give you some free magic cards, can recover a lot of HP with some strength and can transition into a *dark sigil* build
- *azahr the exiled wizard [ANCIENT]*, you can keep it on the side to bring back a daze or immune from your exile at a crucial moment, but *azahr* decks tend never to go down to 4 cards
- *V01-B01 [ROBOT]*, although it does exile you don't want to play it, so it will just stay there and give you 1 mana and resistance each turn
- *Dhorion the holy sentinel [ANCIENT]*, lets you keep your shields and slowly gain resistance, good way of protecting yourself from silence
- nothing, I mean no non exile card, this lets you keep an immune or daze on the side for safety or further use (to prevent a silence debuff for example)

On top of that you will want some exile cards that give resistance, immune, daze and mana. Fight goes as follows : play the resistance cards at the beginning of the fight with some immune or daze for protection. Once you're down to 4 card deck play *wizard III* then all the mana on *energy golem* and then *apprentice guard* at the end if enemies intend to attack. You can play it twice if you need more shields, or play *wizard III* twice for extra resistance from overcharge.
You can use a way to get armored like *Robowitch [ROBOT]* or *Dhorion the holy sentinel [ANCIENT]* and then you won't have to play *apprentice guard* all the time.

**Advice** : this strategy works very well on high inferno where you have more gold and need consistency.

## Other strategy: infinite loops or infinite immunes

These you need to be aware of because you might want to switch to one if you have the opportunity:
- *Dark sigil* (skill) can provide you with great power, with *magic leaf* and some strength (from overcharge for example) you can fully recover the HP loss and kill everything on first turn
- *Cthool the darkmaster [ANCIENT]* and *Azahr the exiled wizard [ANCIENT]* can both bring back immunes or daze infinitely, you won't be killing first turn but you will be immune all the time so it's an easy win. *Cthool* is harder to use but stays for sure in your deck, *azahr* you will need some mana to meet the knowledge requirement to keep him but wizard it should be fine, so given the choice I'd go for *Azahr the exiled wizard [ANCIENT]*
- *Key of the portal* (skill) can be brought back by *Azahr the exiled wizard [ANCIENT]* without any overcharge and you can even gain mana infinitely that way. Provided your deck is small enough, that easily becomes a first turn kill.
- *Heroic Blacksmith* with *V01-B01 [ROBOT]* and a 4 card deck, harder to pull off as wizard but it's another idea if the stars align

Note that all of these require small enough deck (sometimes 4 cards), which is another reason to have small decks.
Keep in mind that these loops still have enemies that can be annoying (silence debuff, backfire damage...) so you will still have to prepare for that

## High inferno advice :

Early survival is the hardest part, getting past world 1 is very hard and most of the time once you've past it and reached first market of world 2 you're almost sure to win. This is why you need to take stuff that is good early just to get through even if it means your deck is not building itself perfectly for late game.
You don't have time for quests (except *wizard I*) or *mage thief*, although you might want them mid game.
Your priority is to get immunes/daze and class upgrade, this way you can survive first turns until you get your extra mana and then use shields for the rest of the fight.

You want to remove enough cards to be able to play *energy golem* twice a turn (on a good draw).
Your key cards are *wizard I* and *apprentice guard* so buy or take them as soon as you see them. Once you have *apprentice guard*, you should be able to tank hits with the two mana from spheres, *wizard I* will increase its potenially once the quest is completed. By the way do not try to hard to complete the quest, it will finish on its own pretty fast.

Other than that you will want some free mana cards to get spheres ASAP and some resistance to shield both before and after you get *apprentice guard*. But you should take the ones offered to you as fight rewards or in chests because you need your money for more important stuff.

Here's a list of what you want to buy early:

### Services

- Class upgrade
- Card remove
- Card transform

### Common

- *Apprentice guard*
- *Wizard I*

### Uncommon

- *Snow queen*
- *Sigil essence*
- *Medusa [BEASTMAN]*
- *Xatior, order of the wizards*
- *Blue witch*

### Rare

- *Druid of the high elves* (expensive)

The cards you want to pick up are listed in the general good cards section with the exception of *earth seed I*, *mage thief*, *wizard of Nature* and *Robowitch [ROBOT]*, because they won't help you early.
*Wizard of nature* can be considered only if you have *blue witch* already and *Earth seed I* if you have *apprentice guard* already.

For skills, prioritize defensive and cheap ones, basically all the skills listed in good skills section are good early, except last three (*Necronomicon*, *Dark sigil* and *Mana Battery*), mostly because of their downside/cost.

It is very good to take the 100 gold for 4 gems if you need to make an important purchase.

## Problematic enemies

Some enemies are probalematic for wizard and you will want to prepare for them, but your priority is to get a deck that defeats regular enemies before going over the problematic ones.
Nevertheless here they are:

### Silence enemies

If you have *seeker of the light* you're fine, with *tear of goddess* too but you probably shouldn't have taken it

**w2**

- Both bosses in Deep water,
One inflicts silence if you take damage from him, so should be avoidable with a regular deck
The other one inflicts 2 silence before attacking then passing. You can take the hit if you're not prepared yet (you will be blinded after first hit but don't worry they pass on the second silence turn) or you can use a daze or armor.

- Pharaoh, desert boss, he just inflicts block on the turn you're silenced, so no problem

**w3**

- Bats, lost world normal enemy, the hardest one, *frost nova* prevents the first one (from the left), but you can also use a daze card. It's hard to get enough shields to make armor work on the first one.
Then you will have to kill the right one before he silences you too and then the middle one. If you keep getting silenced you will lose too much time and they will cruch you

- Void II elite (don't remember his name), he deals one silence on turn 1 then again later, you can take the hit, use a daze or some armor

**w4+**

- Terror from the deep, land of dragons boss, by that time you've got to have daze, prioritze them on the silence debuff, but you can also prevent the spawns if you have enough

- Last boss, best thing against him is armor, you can also shield before attacking so that when silence comes you don't care, you can also restart the fight and hope not to get randomly silenced

### Other problematic enemies

- Void III elite that deals 10 damage when playing two consecutive magic or combat cards, you can use immunes to prevent the damage at the beginning, when your deck is small enough you can fit in *apprentice guard* in between magic cards. And with armor you can keep enough shield to always tank the hits. Keep in mind that playing 3 magic cards in a row will only deal you 10 damage, so something like magic, combat, magic, magic, magic is ok if you can get 10 shields by 4th card.

- Skeleton trio is hard because you probably won't be fast enough to kill the king before skeletons flood your deck (unless with a turn 1 kill, see infinite loops). You will have to play some of them. I suggest playing the first ones ASAP to keep a small deck and stop playing them when you think you won't have to play any more before you complete the kill.
Your best defense option is *book of magic* which should almost fully revover the HP loss from *skeletons*. If you have *Nephil* or *magic leaf* and strength you're good too. The other thing that can help you survive is *Phoenix feather*.
If you don't have a way to recover HP then your only option is to kill fast enough, so make sure you have that 4 card core and maybe invest in a couple fairy spawns for power.

- Evil elemental, will increase it's power with the overcharge you get from playing energy golem over and over. You might still be able to kill him before his attack is too strong, but if you can't, try to play magic cards without overcharge and only one enrgy golem per turn. You can do full turns of apprentice guard after that.
