# Rogue Adventure - Shaman Guide

## Introduction

Shaman is a class you unlock after reaching level 16, you will probably have played a couple other classes before him.
For guides about other classes I invite you to check https://gist.github.com/adufilie/d9f42d6fbc7fe5dc1f7874e8f4f35572 for a great warrior guide by @fooblizoo and https://github.com/Alexwestbrook/RA/blob/6c9d757bc5b681b46f8e2e07ab3dedd28ece8a52/rogue-adventure-wizard-guide.md for a wizard guide by me.

Shaman can be a hard class to understand at first because there is no clear strategy to play it. However it is a very powerful class early if you play it right and it can get really strong.
Your ability lets you stack thunder or fire points everytime you play a card and release them with the totems. Unlike wizard or necromancer, once released you lose your stack
(less so with class upgrade) so you have to build it again everytime. Even so, this ability deals a lot of damage and shaman is a class that can get huge burn stacks that can do all the killing. Your deck should be mostly focused on defense.

Shaman has many options when it comes to building its deck. You can focus on magic or combat cards, or do a mix of both. From inferno 1 to 10, you can focus on inflicting burns or just using the thunder damage but in higher infernos only the burns will let you kill high HP enemies.

As for any class, World 1 will become the most difficult part of the run, because you need to improve your deck quickly before first elite and then to defeat *Gorilla King* or *Evil Forest Guardian*. You will lose some runs early simply because you didn't find any good cards. Don't feel too bad about it.

### Purpose of this Guide

This guide aims to help both beginners in low infernos (1-10) and advanced players in high infernos (20+). Some advice applies for both and some is more specific.
This guide is any game mode, the first part is meant for classic and should apply to hell which is quite similar. And the last part is about what is different in void mode.
Finally I do not take into account when the cards are unlocked, if you haven't all the cards unlocked yet (level 30) you can read this guide and try with the cards available to you, but I strongly recommend trying stuff by yourself to learn which cards are good, which ones are bad and which ones synergies well together.

## Some important tricks to know

When starting a run, you can pick the map you want while keeping your starting bonus. Before you pick your starting bonus, try looking in the background to see if it's the map you want. If not, kill the app and re-open it, then start a new run instead of continuing. Your starting bonus will still be offered in the new run.
On very high Infernos (30+) this is a must, as you likely won't be able to survive two consecutive battles before the first Merchant.
There is one map which has a Merchant after the first fight.

You can restart a fight. Quit from the menu and select continue to restart the fight from the beginning.
Do this if you make a critical error or an important random outcome is not favorable.
*Key of the Portal* (Skill) protects you from a bad starting hand. Combine with the restart fight trick above to get the best results.
Besides *Key of the Portal*, there are other ways to alter the outcome of your first few turns. Although the starting hand and starting deck order for a fight is fixed, there are a few cards which produce random outcomes that can be optimized by restarting the fight. Some examples: *Old Jester*, *Cthool Acolyte*, *Cthool Apprentice*.
*Night Fairy [FAIRY]* shuffles your deck, so you could play *Night Fairy [FAIRY]* during your first turn just to escape a bad opening shuffle.
Similarly, if you can run through your cards once and trigger a new shuffle, you may restart the fight if you find that the second shuffle isn't so good.

## Description of abilities:

You have a thunder form and a fire form. Playing the totem of the other form will make you change form. Every time you play a card you gain 1 thunder or fire point depending
on your current form, changing form will reset counter to 0 and release 8 damage to a random enemy per thunder point or 3 burns to all enemies per fire point.
Note that the totem card played will count as first card played in the new form, so the counter will be at one after changing form. The thunder damage is unaffected by strength, double damage or weak, and doesn't count as a hit one enemies with backfire damage.

**Class upgrade**: After changing form you keep half the points from the previous form. It is rounded down but you will get your extra point from the totem. 5 points will become 2, then 3 with the totem. 2 will become 1, then 2 again with the totem, so switching form every card played will result in double points compared to without class upgrade, but switching rarely will result more in +50% points.

**Base deck**:

2x *Mage* : deal 3 damage, apply 3 weak

3x *Fire totem* : gain 3 shields, if in thunder form switch to fire form

3x *Thunder totem* : gain 3 shields, if in fire form switch to thunder form


## Class bonus

Every class unlocks a new class bonus after inferno 2, 5 and 10.

**Class bonus 1** - Thunder points will deal 8 damage to all enemies instead of one random. Beware that this changes thunder damage to be affected by double damage, weak, dark grasp and to trigger rockhorn, electric jellyfish or sapphire drake. This class bonus is very good in early infernos (I1-10) but it gets obsolete once enemies start having too much HP.

**Class bonus 2** - Fire points will apply 6 burns to all enemies instead of 3. This is the best bonus for very high infernos (I30+) beacause the burns will be your main source of damage. You can also use it early but it might not be as good as the others.

**Class bonus 3** - Heal 2 hp every time you change form. Once unlocked this is the best class bonus up to I30 or so. It will help you recover and synergies pretty well with the class upgrade and dark sigil.

All shaman class bonuses are nice and despite my advice you can play with whatever you find most fun. However on very high infernos the second one will be best because enemies have too much HP to be killed with thunder and they deal too much damage to recover it with class bonus 3.
This is also because you will want to use cards like *Melgaroth[ANCIENT][DEMON]* that synergies with burns.

## Starting bonus

You get a starting bonus after every time you've completed first world. You don't have to use a starting bonus but it helps. If you lose in World 1, play a different class or inferno level to beat the first Boss and earn your next starting bonus. If you're trying to advance other classes at the same time, you can take this as an opportunity to alternate between them and shaman. If you want the starting bonus ASAP, pick Barbarian or Ranger, choose Normal difficulty, and you can beat World 1 in one to two minutes.
You can quit immediately after defeating the Boss, on the rewards screen. (You can also use Shaman with 1st class bonus on Normal, but switching class bonuses isn't a great idea).

That said, in high infernos you will restart a lot and taking time to get the starting bonus isn't always worth it. You can also just restart enough until you get some good rewards and shops.

**2 Gems** - Never pick this. 100 Coins is worth more.

**100 Coins** - This is the consistency choice, I recommend it up to I30, if you want you can keep using it until I49 where rare card or skill is necessary to win first fight.

**Random Rare** - This is probably your best option past I49. There are a few nice starting bonuses that will help you, but the very best is *Melgaroth, Keeper of Flames [ANCIENT][DEMON]* which can bring you up to I105 on 2nd class bonus.
However you might end up with a useless card most of the time, wasting your starting bonus, which is why I recommend it only once first fight becomes impossible.

**Random Skill** - You can try your luck here, but there are a lot of skills. Most of the time you will get something barely useful if not completely useless. However it can be nice if you want a little help in the run and they're almost never bad.
The theoretical max inferno for shaman is I121 and you can only do it with *Dark Sigil* and 3rd class bonus. But because you are very unlikely to get it and you will probably die before you find some healing, you should do this only past I105 when it's your only chance of survival.

If you are interested in theoretical limits and records, you can check https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18iEOCVwMW5eJfRHM1KzpZFG6p_egl5-_/edit?rtpof=true. Just say ask @Gerr for access. You can contact him on discord. 

## Picking your path

To maximize your chances of survival, you want a path that gives you the most Merchants and Chests, and the least Elites.
In world 1, you will want a Merchant early to prepare for the rest of the world, and one close to the Boss so you can use all the Coins you've accumulated so far to prepare for the Boss fight.
In other worlds you can afford to wait a little longer for the first market.

## General deck strategy

**Mana** - Every deck benefits from getting extra Mana each turn, but even more so for shaman since your damage comes from number of cards played. You have a lot of options, the best card early are *Souls Priestess* or *Souls Guardian*, but you can also use *Wizard III* or even *Lady of the Knight* if you have a combat card related deck. These cards give overcharge so you will want only one, but there are other cards that you can use *Sou, the blade of wind* or *V01-B01 [ROBOT]*.

**Defense first** - Build up your defense quickly or you will likely lose. Don't get too many attack cards. Look for cards with immune or daze like *Snow queen* or *Medusa [BEASTMAN]*. These are the best to defend first turn before you setup your deck. You want to make sure you can draw one of them on turn 1, which is where you are most vulnerable.
These cards exile so you will also want a permanent shield cards with multiplying effect like *Apprentice Guard* or *Alestar, the tranquility defender [ANCIENT]*. Another option for defense is *Melgaroth, the Keeper of Flames [ANCIENT][DEMON]* which can turn burns into shields.
Try to get to a point where you are not losing any HP.

**Permanent buffs** - Strength doesn't benefit shaman, but favor resistance buffs that last until the end of the fight instead of temporary end-of-turn buffs. *Blue witch*, *Sigil essence*, *Dhorion* and *Wizard of Nature* are the best cards for this.

**Card type** - You can use any card type as shaman, but focusing on magic cards will make *blue witch* and *Elder fairy [FAIRY]* better whereas focusing on combat cards will make *Lady of the Knight* and *Dark shielded knight* better. Keep that in mind when building your deck. Depending on the run, you might want some cards more than others.

**Playing with shaman points** - It can be hard to understand when to switch from one form to the other at first. On low infernos, thunder might give you enough damage to kill enemies quickly so you will want to focus on that. But in higher infernos and against high hp enemies, burns will kill enemies faster because they stack.
Before you get class upgrade you will lose all your points by changing form. If you're focusing on burns you will want to release them by changing to thunder, then go back ASAP to fire form to start stacking fire points again. Burns will deal more damage in a long fight but thunder damage is better to finish off the enemy. Even with 2nd class bonus you will want to stack some thunder in the last turn to kill before they attack (burn is applied after the enemy's attack). 

Try to time the releases according to needs. Releasing burns every turn will mean you stack fewer fire points, you might want to hold onto them until 2nd turn and then release them. With class upgrade you might want to change form more often to get the extra points, but i still recommend spending a bit more time in fire form than thunder, specially in the first few turns (play your exile cards to setup your deck while in fire form). If you have Melgaroth, wait until he's in your hand to change to thunder form, class upgrade or not.

**Small deck** - A smaller deck will be more consistent. When your deck grows to about 12 cards or more, it becomes unlikely that you will see key cards each turn, unless you have ways to cycle through your deck faster. It also makes you less likely to draw an immune card on turn 1. On the other hand, a 4 card deck means every card you play comes right back in your hand. Note that you must always have at least 6 cards in your deck, but if 2 of them exile or remove, then you're left with a 4 card core.

## What reward to take after a fight

Most of the time you should be taking 1 Gem after a fight, unless you see a card that you would have bought anyway or one you know works well with your chosen strategy.
Don't take random cards just because they are free, because they can clog up your hand and make it harder to win.
Even if you see a card that would be good for late game, you may not want to take it early. For early game, prioritize cards that will help you survive.

## What to do at the Merchant

**Melgaroth** - In low infernos this card isn't necessary, specially without 2nd class bonus. But on higher infernos it's a must. Whenever you find that card you should buy it (one copy is enough). If you have enough money it is worth rerolling cards in every merchant until you find it.

**Heal** - When your HP is low and your defense is not well developed yet, I recommend healing at the Merchant rather than buying a card that will heal you slowly.
If you're HP is still over 50% and you think you can survive until the next Merchant, you don't need to heal.

**Thin your deck** - Your starting deck includes many duplicates which will get in the way of the ther good cards you will add to your deck.
I recommend Removing or Transforming at least one of each in first two worlds. If you have enough money for both, start by transforming one so you can remove the new card after if it's bad.
The *Mage* is pretty bad and you should remove the last one once you find a better option for weak (that weakens all enemies at once).
If you have the money and *circular shield* skill, you might want to remove the last duplicates of your totems to get down to a 4 card deck and get plenty of shields form your skill. However always keeps at least one of each or you won't be able to use your ability anymore.

**Upgrade the class skill** - The class skill is nice but not necessary, priority goes to removing one base card of each type and other good defense cards. You will usually upgrade it in world 3 or 4 but you can finish the run without it.

**Duplicating** - If you have a very good card like *Elder fairy [FAIRY]* you might want to duplicate it for 300 gold in merchant, I recommend this once the rest of your deck is good enough and you just want that extra preparation time in battle.

**Consider trading Gems for Coins** - Once you have 4 Gems, you will be able to trade them for 100 Coins, so keep that in mind when looking at card prices.
Similarly, when you have 7 Gems you can afford the *Gold Ingot* skill which gives 300 Coins.

**Spend wisely** - If you don't see any good options and you think you can survive until the next Merchant, save your Coins and Gems. If the next Merchant is 2 or 3 fights away and you think you need to prepare for those, don't be afraid to Reroll cards or skills if you can afford something nice that could show up.

## General good cards:

### Overcharged mana card (1)
common
- *Wizard I*, bad mana early but highest mana giver if you can set it up
- *Sapphire guard*, mana isn't great but it also gives shield, decent option before you get one of the above, but you still want another overcharged mana card. It can synergies with *Lady of the Knight* for a combat card focused deck.
- *Young witch*, gives a lot of mana but exiles so can only be used once

uncommon
- *Souls priestess*, best option for early mana and searching through the deck
- *Souls guardian*, good mana early
- *Lady of the Knight*, good mana if deck focused on combat card

### Other mana cards
common
- *Old jester*, free to play, exiles and can search for a rare card
- *Spirit of magic I [ANCIENT]*, free to play early and deals weak, still good once upgraded but no longer a free mana card, also is ancient
- *Spirit of defense I [ANCIENT]*, free to play early and a little defense, pretty bad once upgraded though, only take early for a little help or if ancient build
- *Fairy princess [FAIRY]*, not free to pley but gives other free cards and exiles, decent for early fight and gives some healing

uncommon
- *Sou, the blade of wind [ANCIENT]*, gives good mana if played first, good option all game long unless you are going for a 4 card *circular shield* deck, also is ancient
- *Moon fairy [FAIRY]*, free mana card and search option
- *High priest*, free mana card but bad search option
- *Magic leaf*, activation is free, can give decent shield and can also be used as weak option even though it doesn't affect all enemies. It can transition into a *dark sigil* first turn kill deck too

rare
- *V01-B01 [ROBOT]*, gives mana without having to be played but doesn't work if overcharged (not great with *Souls priestess/guardian*), resistance is decent too
- *Elder fairy [FAIRY]*, great setup card, removes so can only be used once, worth duplicating.

### Weak (1)
common
- *Spirit of magic I [ANCIENT]*, great for weak and mana early, great for weak on all enemies once upgraded, best option
- *High witch I*, once upgraded exiles and deals enough weak for the whole fight, frees up space in the deck
- *Forgotten priestess*, not a lot of weak but its on all enemies and protects you from block, frail, wound and sometimes curse, but not silence unfortunately

uncommon
- *Keyra, the Shy Soul [ANCIENT]*, doesn't give a lot of weak but is ancient and can give shields
- *Necromancer acolyte*, give a litle more weak, damage is pointless but curse can be annoying

### Resistance
uncommon
- *Blue witch*, can give 4 res, incredible on magic focused deck and still decent otherwise
- *Sigil essence*, 2 res and immune, very good option
- *Sun priestess*, gives 2 res but has bad synergy with demons (*Melgaroth*) so usually avoid it 
- *Fairy queen [FAIRY] I*, bad before the quest and hard one to complete, but on low inferno you might have time to play it 30 times and get the quest done, decent res after the quest but not amazing for the effort

rare
- *Druid of the high elves*, mana cost is pretty high but gives 2 res and immune ultimately
- *Dhorion, the holy Sentienl [ANCIENT]*, gives 1 res at the end of every turn if played right, plus armor. Little slow but combined with first turn protection (immune, daze, skills) it's the best resistance option
- *Wizard of Nature*, doubles the res, only take it if you already have other means of getting some res
- *Gorgrirath [DEMON]*, converts burns to temporary res, combine it with *Wizard of Nature* to make it permanent or with armor to use it to get high shields that you will keep for other turns

### Shields
common
- *Apprentice guard*, great scaling shield effect when combined with some resistance and extra mana
- *Demon guard [DEMON]*, can give you good shields on a demon deck, since you will be going for *Melgaroth* anyway, and if played first you won't lose hp. 

uncommon
- *Alestar, the Tranquility Defender [ANCIENT]*, good shield value if you have some res and ancients, synergies well with all the other ancients you want anyway. Also doesn't need to be played so counts as an extra card, and can be used for shield bash with some armor. You can get multiple copies of this one.
- *Dark shielded knight*, good shield value even without res if you have a combat card related deck
- *Cthool Acolyte*, good flat shield value and thins the deck, annoying late game though

rare
- *Melgaroth, the Keeper of Flames [ANCIENT][DEMON]*, converts burns to shields, you lose your burns for offense but it gives plenty of shields, particularily with 2nd class bonus
- *Ambassadress of peace*, good flat shield value and useful armor, less good in high inferno, not worth buying

### Armor
uncommon
- *Iron colossus [ROBOT]*, gives a little armor but not enough by itself, can be coupled with *Dhorion*

rare
- *Dhorion, the Holy Sentinel [ANCIENT]*, gives unlimited armor if you can get it in your hand at the end of every turn. Small deck helps, and can be coupled with another card/skill giving little armor in case you miss it at the end of one turn. It's also ancient and gives plenty of res.
- *Robowitch [ROBOT]*, gives enough armor for the entire fight most of the time, but it can be useful to have a little more
- *Space commander*, gives little amount of armor but stays in your deck, if you have the time to play it, then it can give you infinite armor
- *Blessed Lady [ANGEL]*, gives less armor than *Robowitch* but also gives a little healing and you can easily have 4+ armor. The card is angel, *Melgaroth* is ancient and demon, and you can grab a fairy with *Moon fairy*, *Elder Fairy* or *Fairy Princess*, a robot with *V01-B01* or *Iron colossus*, and a beastman with *Medusa*.
- *Ambassadress of peace*, not a lot of armor but it can be coupled with *Dhorion*

### Immune/daze
common
- *Earth seed I*, bad card before quest is completed, but great daze card after. nly take it if you can complete the quest, *Melgaroth* makes the quest easy to complete.

uncommon
- *Snow queen*, great immune card
- *Sigil essence*, immune, empty pile requirement can be annoying but you should have a small deck anyway. Res is very good too
- *Medusa [BEASTMAN] I*, good daze card before the quest, even better if you complete the quest but it's unlikely to have poison as shaman
- *Xatior, order of the wizards*, good daze card, removes instead of exiling so you can't take it back with *Azahr, the Exiled Wizard [ANCIENT]*, *Cthool, the Darkmaster [ANCIENT]*, or *The Timeshifter [ANGEL]*. Once you have it you can go for *Ixar, order of the wizards* for the combo, but keep your deck small to be able to pull it off

rare
- *Druid of the High Elves*, mana cost is pretty high but it gives the immune as well as res and small healing

### Heal
common
- *Fairy princess [FAIRY]*, gives small healing as well as free mana cards

uncommon
- *Seeker of the light*, good healing, protection from debuffs (including silence), it takes space in your deck but can provide unlimited healing if you have the mana to do so

rare
- *Druid of the High Elves*, you want it for res and immune but there is small healing
- *Nephil [ANGEL]*, gives fast healing if you go below 50% hp, damage is decent early but otherwise you won't be playing it
- *Ultron [ROBOT]*, decent damage early when at low hp, also gives a free magic card with little healing, gets obsolete pretty fast and not worth spending gold on, but decent starting bonus

### Damage
rare
- *Melgaroth, the Keeper of Flames [ANCIENT][DEMON]*, doubles the burn when in your hand, and gives a shield option. Very powerful and interesting card, specially with 2nd class bonus. It can even be used for a shield bash strategy with some armor. Works best on small decks
- *Beast emperor [BEASTMAN]*, doubles damage from thunder points if you have 1st class bonus
- *Witch of Flames*, I normally wouldn't recommend it, it's definitely not worth buying, but with *melgaroth* the double burn turn into triple and the triple into multiplying by 5. It can be useful to kill Gorilla or other powerful single enemies, and you can always convert the burns back to shields with *Melgaroth*

### Money
uncommon
- *Mage thief*, gives gold, it's very useful once you know you can afford to waste some turns in your fight (usually mid game), it's great to get rid of the base deck or duplicate *elder fairy [FAIRY]*

### Bringing back exile
uncommon
- *Guardian of heavens [ANGEL]*, can get you a blue witch or immune back from exile, a bit slow but could be worth it

rare
- *Cthool, the Darkmaster [ANCIENT]*, this card duplicates any exile card you play, if you have *snow queen* or *Earth seed II*, you can play it every turn and be untouchable
- *Azahr, the Exiled Wizard [ANCIENT]*, this card duplicates a card from your exile twice, if you played 4 cards already (with some extra mana) you keep it in your deck and have an infinite cycle of immunes or daze. It's also great without staying in your deck, duplicating an exiled card twice is enough.
- *The Timeshifter [ANGEL]*, gets all your exile cards back, can be great but there's often some cards you don't want to play again and it makes the mana cost pretty high


## General good skills:

- *Invisibility potion* (5 gems), good and cheap first turn protection
- *Ice block* (7 gems), good protection that can be save for crucial moment
- *Demon eye* (7 gems), extra mana at the cost of blind, learn enemy patterns and blind is no longer a problem
- *Gold ingot* (7 gems), 300 gold is a lot you can upgrade, buy a rare card or duplicate a card with that. You can also buy multiple cheaper stuff
- *Circular shield* (8 gems), great source of shield with a small deck, with 8 cards it's 10 shield per turn after 1st turn, with 4 cards it's 10 shields per card played
- *Book of magic* (8 gems), great healing once you have extra mana and magic card focused deck
- *Piece of coal* (8 gems), 2 resistance is good for defense, you can restart the fight to get different debuffs until you get weak and blind (sometimes block is fine too)
- *Frost nova* (9 gems), great first turn protection, essentially gives you a free turn at the start of the fight, also avoids many first turn enemy spawns
- *Key of the portal* (9 gems), 1 extra mana on first turn and reshuffle option, very good for consistency and setup
- *Freezing shot* (9 gems), once you have spheres and some mana generation you can daze an enemy almost every turn, single enemies don't stand a chance
- *Necronomicon* (9 gems), extra mana at the cost of hp, do not take too early if you can't block attacks with immunes or shields yet, but great skill mid game
- *Dark sigil* (11 gems), most powerful and dangerous skill, go to skill with 3rd class bonus, otherwise only take it if your deck has enough healing
- *Mana battery* (12 gems), bit expensive early but allows you to save mana for important turns, opens up a very different playstyle. It's great to get tons of gold with mage thief if you gave lots of shields and armored

## Other useful skills:

- *Telescope* (5 gems), cheap and effective, you can plan your path to get hard fights right after market, still a bit inconsistent
- *Torch* (5 gems), cheap skill and helps you get better rewards after fights
- *Snail shell* (6 gems), little armor to combine with *Dhorion*
- *Purple potion* (7 gems), decent if you have *demon eye* already, it's a sure 1 str/res every turn but the first, plus some extra when receiving debuffs
- *Rabbit paw* (8 gems), not a priority but once your deck is well rounded, curse is one of the things that can still kill you. I often take it right before final boss.
- *Phantom spear* (8 gems), deals a lot of damage but you usually don't need it, still much better than *dark sword* which is a waste of gems.
- *Book of resistance* (8 gems), 1 resistance is decent but not great for 8 gems
- *Stone skin* (8 gems), on high inferno you might be often below 50% HP, specially early, so 3 resistance is very good
- *Scorpion claw* (9 gems), expensive for what it is, but once your deck is well rounded you can take it for safety, *rabbit paw* is better
- *Darkness boots* (9 gems), good shields on low inferno against multiple enemies but a bit expensive for what it is
- *Blessing of sanctuary* (10 gems), good once your deck is well rounded and you're afraid of a mistake, for example when you have *demon eye* (if you trigger it then restart the fight, you get it back)
- *Phoenix feather* (10 gems), same as above, slightly worse in my opinion
- *Phantom boots* (13 gems), allows you to avoid almost every elite and go for plenty of chests/merchants, bit expensive and you still have to fight bosses but overall makes the game easy
- *Tear of goddess* (15 gems), very expensive skill but saves you from the block/silence nightmare, only once your deck is well rounded

## Attack strategies

Your attack strategy with Shaman will come from your shaman points. You don't need raw attack cards, only take them if they help you defend.
If you are playing 1st class bonus, *Beast emperor* is the card you want for double damage on thunder points. If you're playing with 2nd or 3rd, *Melgaroth* is the best offense card. Take only one of the two and only one copy. Rest is defense. Finally with 3rd class bonus you can take *Dark sigil* skill because you can recover the hp loss and it will let you play roughly double the amount of cards in your turn (so more shaman points and defense too).
My preference goes to 2nd class bonus *Melgaroth* because it provides defense as wall as offense and it's easier to get a rare card than an expensive skill. Then 3rd class bonus *Dark sigil* is probably the most powerful and also provides defense, but harder to find the skill, plus it can also use *Melgaroth*. And finally 1st class bonus *Beast emperor* doesn't provide much defense at all. You can also use *Melgaroth* but it would be expensive and you would be having too many attack cards IMO.

What follows are some example of builds you can use for defense. Most of them I tested with 2nd class bonus but you can adapt them with other attack strategies.
Race builds tend to take more time to build because you need many cards to make them worth. Best decks usually ignore race synergies to build a good deck, and can transition to a race build if the right cards are offered. 

### Race build: Ancients

**+** Strong defense and offense, most ancient cards are great regardless of race synergy

**-** Bigger decks, requires some specific cards

The Ancient race is the exception in race builds because so many ancient cards are great and don't care about having other ancients. First of all you will want *Melgaroth* in you deck, you want something to deal weak and the best is *Spirit of Magic [ANCIENT] II*, you want mana and *Sou [ANCIENT]* is great for that, you want armor and res, given by *Dhorion [ANCIENT]*. None of these cards depend on other ancients so you want them anyway, and then you can go for *Alestar [ANCIENT]* to get shields. You just need 3 ancients and some res to make *alestar [ANCIENT]* worth it, and if you have some armor, *alestar [ANCIENT]* can turn your deck into a very powerful shield bash deck. You can get your shields with *Alestar [ANCIENT]* or *Melgaroth* and then quickly kill with *Alestar [ANCIENT]* on another turn.

You can also use one of the broken cards that gring back exile like *Azahr [ANCIENT]* or *Cthool, the Darkmaster [ANCIENT]* which are ancient too, but usually you get them to do an infinite cycle of daze/immune so you don't really need the ancient synergy. *Keyra [ANCIENT]* is also a decent alternative to *Spirit of magic II* for weak and is ancient too, *Spirit of defense [ANCIENT] I* can be useful early for extra defense and mana and can also be useful for ancient synergy. Finally *Mystic bird* isn't ancient but scales with them, so you can take it for extra defense once you have many ancients but maybe not alestar yet.

Be careful most of these ancient cards don't exile, and when they do you don't want to get rid of them, so this can result in bug decks. Make sure you remove a lot of base cards (2 mages and 1 totem of each) and don't get too many other non exile cards (a mana cards is enough, maybe a shield card too if you don't have an ancient one yet).
Since *Sou [ANCIENT]*, *Alestar [ANCIENT]* and *Dhorion [ANCIENT]* are combat cards, taking *Lady of the knight* as mana card can be worth it.

### Race build : Demons

**+** Good burn cards, good shields, shield bash option

**-** Not many useful demons, harder to setup, adds attack cards

Since *Melgaroth* is demon you could go for the demon race. You can take *Demon guard [DEMON]* which gives decent shields and doesn't lose you hp if you play it first. You can exceptionnaly use *Succubus [DEMON] II* which is an attack card but it deals a lot of burns, specially with *Melgaroth* and it makes *Demon guard [DEMON]* better.
You also have *Gorgrirath [DEMON]* that can help you defend, it's an alternative to *Melgaroth* if you can't get it early. It's less good but with a proper build it can get very powerful. You can use *Wizard of Nature* to make the huge amount of temporary res permanent, or you can use it to get plenty of shields on one turn and keep it with some armor. Then you can go for *Guardian of demons [DEMON]* for a shield bash strategy.

You can combine ancients and demons, *alestar [ANIENT]* can be your shield bash card and *dhorion [ANCIENT]* your armor card, *gorgrirath [DEMON]* couples well with *alestar* since it will make use of all the temparary res for shields, and then with armor alestar can do the shield bash on it's own.

Note that the demons offered here don't lose you hp, except sometimes *Demon guard [DEMON]*, you can also take *Living Armor [DEMON]* early which gives decent shields. It doesn't scale but it will make *Demon guard [DEMON]* better. Having 3rd class bonus can help recover hp loss from these two cards.

Most of the demon cards are combat so going for *Dark shielded knight* as a defense card works too, and *Lady of the knight* is a decent mana card.

### Race build : Fairies

**+** Many free mana cards for shaman points

**-** Hard to setup, vulnerable in first turns

A bit like for wizard or necromancer, you could use fairy spawns to play many cards and get shaman points. It's less good on shaman because you lose you points every time you use them, but with class upgrade it's better and you might get enough spawns to kill with the first couples releases. MAke sure you play your spawns in fire form so that all the burns you generate can bring down the enemy even once you are out of spawns.

*Fairy princess [FAIRY]* is the spawn card that doesn't rely on race synergy, the magic cards requirement is relatively easy for shaman. You will also want *Moon fairy [FAIRY]* and *Elder fairy [FAIRY]* regardless of race synergy. *Elder fairy [FAIRY]* removes and no longer counts as a fairy in your deck, but if you play the spawns before then *Elder fairy [FAIRY]* will count.

Once you have a couple good fairies anyway you can go for the fairy spawns, best are *Blue bloom [FAIRY]* and *Blessed Fairy [FAIRY][ANGEL]* because their spawns give shields which will help you defend. But you can also take *Red bloom [FAIRY]*, it's one of your poison options if you want to complete the quest for *Medusa [BEASTMAN] I*.
You might want a source of armored like *Robowitch [ROBOT]* to keep the shields generated by the spawns, because you are likely to use them all in a single turn and have a lot of overflow shields. 

You will eventually run out of spawn cards and will have to finish the fight without them. The burns will do the killing but you need permanent shield option. *Apprentice guard* is always a good option but with the fairy spawn strategy, your fairy race counter lets you use *fairy warrior [FAIRY]*, *lullyp [BEASTMAN][FAIRY]* or *mystic bird* as scaling defense cards.

The other fairies you can use are *Fairy queen [FAIRY] I*, the quest is easier to complete on a fairy deck, and maybe *Night Fairy [FAIRY]*, this card lets you reshuffle your deck and grab all the fairy spawns in your exile immediately, very good if you have *dark sigil* and want them for healing before you cycle through your whole deck. As it doesn't exile, it can get annoying in your deck but it's alright. Beware you might not want the overcharge which will make the spawns not free anymore, so be careful to have another race in your deck.

Finally you can also use *The Timeshifter [ANGEL]* to bring back all your fairy spawns from your exile for a second round. Since you get both the spanwner and the spawnees, it's like getting triple the amount of spawns. The Angel counter can be useful for *Blessed Fairy [FAIRY][ANGEL]* too.

Important to know about this strategy is that it is slow, playing all the fairy spawn cards takes time at the beginning of the fight and leaves you vulnerable.
You can use *Elder fairy [FAIRY]* to get extra mana to play all the fairy spawns, you can use immune to protect your self while doing so, and finally once you have enough fairy spawns you can take *dark sigil*. This will let you play all your magic cards for 2 HP instead of mana. Since most spawns heal 3 under 50% HP, you will be able to maintain HP while playing all your spawns. But be very careful not to die before you get to them or once you've played them all and don't have any healing left.
For that you can use skills like *Book of magic* which heals half of the HP loss, or *Nephil [ANGEL]* who heals you 6 HP when below 50%. Of course if you have 3rd class bonus, hp loss isn't an issue.

**Specific skills**:

- *Shield of shadows* (6 gems), basically 3 shields per spawn card, that's quite a lot
- *Solid shell* (7 gems), decent shields but more expensive than *shield of shadows* and less shields
- *Fairy doll* (8 gems), gives you an exile card counting for 3 fairies, not the best skill but decent
- *Dark sigil* (11 gems), as I said before fairy spawns help you maintain HP and *dark sigil* helps you play all the spawns on turn 1. Game changing skill, usually a sure win once you've secured hp recovery
- *Opal stone* (18 gems), expensive but counts as 2 fairies for free, the 2 angels can be good for *Blessed Fairy [FAIRY][ANGEL]* too. Keep in mind that you get 2 demons on the counter so *sun priestess* will give you debuff. It's also good for Demon or Ancient build but not as much.

**Alternative** : get some strength and you can kill enemies with the spawns from *Blessed Fairy [FAIRY][ANGEL]* if you have enough fairies and angels in your deck. Even if it isn't enough to commplete the kill you can use *fairy warrior [FAIRY]*, *Lullyp [BEASTMAN][FAIRY]* or *mystic bird* to finish the kill. You can use the skill *Phantom spear* for extra damage and if you have *dark sigil* you might consider taking *Devil's Dead* (11 gems) to get crazy strength and finish quick. Take it only after *dark sigil*.

### 4 card deck

**+** consistent, almost sure win

**-** requires specific skill, need a lot of money to remove, isn't ready early game

Going for a minimal deck with 4 non exile cards is super strong, and that's because of *circular shield* which will give 10 shields for every card. Combined with some extra, you can get to 60-70 shields with just that skill. Not to mention you can play whichever card you want over and over.

If you go for that strategy you need to keep a *Fire totem* and a *Thunder totem* for shaman ability, you will want a mana card (*Sou [ANCIENT]*, *Souls priestess/Guardian*, *Wizard III*) and then the 4th card is up to you, here are the options :
- *Melgaroth* for extra burns and occasionnaly shields if enemies crit too hard for *circular shield*
- *Beast emperor [BEASTMAN]* if you play 1st class bonus
- *Sou [ANCIENT]* for extra mana if it isn't you mana card already
- *V01-B01 [ROBOT]* for extra mana, and res
- *Seeker of the light* for debuff protection and heal
- *Dhorion [ANCIENT]* for armor
- *Azahr [ANCIENT]*, you can keep it on the side to bring back a daze or immune from your exile at a crucial moment, but *Azahr* decks tend never to go down to 4 cards
- a card inflicting weak, you can keep your base *Mage* if you don't have enough money to remove it, you can use *Magic leaf* which will also give some free mana cards and leave a *dark sigil* option, or you can use any of the cards inflicting weak to all enemies
- nothing, I mean no non exile card, this lets you keep an immune or daze on the side for safety or further use (to prevent debuff or crit for example)

You will have to have a couple exile cards on the side, because you need at least 6 cards and you probably will need some stuff early before you can get to that build. Res, immunes, daze and mana cards are all nice. This strategy becomes harder to pull off once the first fights get too hard and you need to get more non exile cards to survive early.

### No race, no broken skill, just *Melgaroth*

**+** consistent, works early

**-** requires *Melgaroth* on high infernos, less good late game

As you get to higher infernos, early game will become the hardest part and you don't have time to setup any of the previous mentioned decks. Your best option is to use *Melgaroth* which will give you plenty of shields while still damaging the enemies you didn't take the burns away from or on the turns where they pass or with the thunder damage. On very high infernos it's almost necessary to take merchant after first fight and get *Melgaroth* in it. For this reason, even if the card reward from first fight could be useful, it's often better to take the gem to be able to reroll cards in the market and find *Melgaroth*.

To get *Melgaroth* consistently in your hand you will need more mana and fewer cards, so remove one copy of each base card ASAP and pick any card giving mana, even *Sapphire guard* is a good option early, although you might want another one. Otherwise stick to the first one you see. Getting immunes and daze can protect you on first turn and can also let you not play *Melgaroth* and keep the burns on the enemies.

Getting armor is great to let you keep the shields you got from *Melgaroth* once and then focus on burns. Beware that late game *Robowitch [ROBOT]* might not give you armor long enough to finish the fight.

At some point you will want to be able to shield without using *Melgaroth*, you can get *Apprentice guard* along with a mana card and some res, it's very good on magic card decks where you can use *blue witch* at its full potential. If you came accross more combat cards like *Sapphire guard*, *Sou [ANCIENT]* or *Dhorion [ANCIENT]*, you can go for *Dark shielded knight* for shields and *Lady of the knight* for mana.

This strategy works well early, and the best way to make it work late game is to get lots of armor and maybe do shield bash. My favorite ending is to transition to an Ancient shield bash strategy with Alestar.

### Other builds: infinite loops or infinite immunes

These you need to be aware of because you might want to switch to one if you have the opportunity:
- *Dark sigil* (skill) can provide you with great power, with *magic leaf* and some strength (from overcharge for example) you can fully recover the HP loss and kill everything on first turn
- *Cthool, the darkmaster [ANCIENT]* and *Azahr, the exiled wizard [ANCIENT]* can both bring back immunes or daze infinitely, you won't be killing first turn but you will be immune all the time so it's an easy win. *Cthool* is harder to use but stays for sure in your deck, *azahr* you will need some mana to meet the knowledge requirement to keep him but it's good even before it.
- *Key of the portal* (skill) can be brought back by *Azahr the exiled wizard [ANCIENT]* without any overcharge and you can even gain mana infinitely that way. Provided your deck is small enough, that easily becomes a first turn kill.
- *Heroic Blacksmith* with *V01-B01 [ROBOT]* and a 4 card deck, harder to pull off but it's another idea if the stars align


## What changes in void mode

Void mode is very different, for starters you don't have a class bonus, which makes some classes much weaker, but shaman stays decent in void mode. You also get a deck with 15 cards including your base 8 and 7 randoms. You can never change the amount of cards and you can only transform 3 of them randomly after normal fights. This means that you need a lot of luck to get a good deck, but you can influence that along the way. You also get to chose 2 skills among 6 after each elite, regardless of price, skill choice is what saves you and can make the next fights a lot easier. You can get your class upgrade after first boss or healing, but I recommend taking the healing after second boss.

All the fights are in the void worlds which makes them pretty hard. First world is Void I which is usually a world 2. Normal fights are already pretty hard and the twisted void essence is a super hard elite to fight with not much more than the deck you were given to start with.

You also need to pay attention to debuffs since void enemies deal a lot of block, silence, wound and curse.
Note that in every world you have 3 normal fights, 2 elites and 1 boss, so you will encounter every void enemy once, only the rder can vary.

In terms of deck strategy you need to keep some exile cards to thin your deck, otherwise you will never dra the cards you want. As Shaman you have no use for attack cards so change them asap. Free mana cards that exile are good, spirit cards are good too because you can always change them once the quest is complete. Get rid of your mages once you find better weak cards (dealing weak to all enemies), keep your totems until you got rid of all the useless attack cards, once you have some better shield cards (even with flat values) you can remove one copy of each totem. But you should keep two of each to be able to draw them reliably.

It's hard to find mana, immunes/daze and res in void, so take whatever you are given, just don't take mermaid queen, quest is impossible to complete. Sapphire guard is very good and you might want two just to draw him every turn, unless you found another mana card.

You will need to heal the hp loss in first world and from wound in other worlds but you don't really have a deck capable of tanking hits to heal. Just keep one healing card in case you have an opportunity, if it exiles it's great. Getting *Nephil [ANGEL]* is very good too or you can use a skill.

### Skills
You don't care about the price, but some cheap skills might still be better. They can really help you make up for the lack of mana, immunes/daze and res.

### Mana :
- *Demon eye*, always a great choice
- *Mana dagger*, great in void mode, since you're unlikely to get an overcharge mana card, it won't interfere with anything. If you play *Sou [ANCIENT]* or *Sapphire Guard* first you still get mana from both
- *Necronomicon*, good choice, by the time you get it you will probably be below 50% hp anyway so you won't lose any hp. But it can make it hard to defeat the Void sword master (Void III elite).
- *Key of the portal*, good help first turn, works as protection for your big deck
- *Mana Battery*, great skill, specially against void absorber (Void II boss) to save mana for shielding later and Void King/Queen to not use your last mana and make sure you don't have any Void globes in your hand

### Immune/daze :
- *Invisibility potion* is good, the fact that its cheap doesn't mean anything
- *Ice block* is good
- *Frost nova* is great, first turn protection is fantastic with the 15 card deck, leaves you time to play all the exile
- *Freezing shot* is good, you won't have a lot of mana so it's harder to use but since most hard void enemies are solitary it can work very well
- *Perfect crystal* is decent, fights will usually take at least 5 turns so you will get to use the immune, but it's not always useful

### Res :
- *Purple potion*, good if you have *demon eye* not really worth it otherwise
- *Book of resistance* is okay, it might be your only res in the entire run
- *Piece of coal* is great, you can restart the fights to avoid annoying debuffs
- *Stone skin* is great too, in the first figths you will often be under 50% HP
- *Kunai attack* isn't great, but if you have enough mana and combat cards you can get some res

### Avoid debuffs :
- *Rabbit paw*, avoid curse, good against Greater void essence (Void I normal and elite), The Unknown (Void I boss) and great against Void King/Queen to avoid having a void globe trapped
- *Scorpion claw*, avoid frail, decent against The Unknown and Evil Fusion (Void II elite)
- *Tear of goddess*, avoid silence and block, great against Trident and Slashing Void guardian (Void II normal)

### Shields :
- *Ghost shield*, not great but first turn protection, specially against Void sword master
- *Shield of shadows*, not great, you won't be playing many exile after first turn
- *Bones armor*, bad for shaman because you will usually get shields form playing your totems
- *Solid shell*, 10 shields every 2 turns reasonably, decent
- *Circular shield*, 10 shield per turn reasonably, decent
- *Rock dagger*, decent reliable shields
- *Darkness boots*, good shields against multiple enemies, you will want to keep your enemies weaken anyway, less good against single enemies

### Healing :
- *Kraken tentacle*, great healing at decisive moment, can save you if you reach first world boss with it
- *Potion maker*, decent healing
- *Soul drain*, decent healing
- *Necklace of life*, great healing when in danger, useful in world 1
- *Book of magic*, great if you can get enough mana to get it every turn, otherwise with some free exile cards like *old jester* you might be able to make it work once per fight which is still decent
- *Bone staff*, good healing, always 3 per enemy dead
- *Amulet of healing*, good healing option, you usually have a healing card in your deck anyway

## Weak :
- *Dark wall*, good way of ensuring weak from the start, not priority but good option
- *Weak dagger*, if you don't find anything else you can take it to have a little more weak, on single enemies you won't have to play your weak cards anymore
- *Dark magic*, normally expensive but here can reduce enemy damage quite a lot since you will weaken them anyway

## Other :
- *Phantom spear*, a lot of additional damage if you have enough amgic cards
- *Blessing of sanctuary*, saves you in case of a problem
- *Phoenix feather*, same as above
- *Dark sigil*, rarely playable in void but if you get the right deck you could take it
- *Opal stone*, normally very expensive, it helps you make use of race scaling defense cards like *Lullyp [BEASTMAN][FAIRY]*, *Mystic bird*, *Demon guard [DEMON]*, etc, or even fairy spawns. You can also make use of *Magic cat* for res, and maybe the other magic animals as free mana remove cards (maybe even get *Chimera*).
