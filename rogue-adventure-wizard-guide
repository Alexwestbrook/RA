Try to focus on a single attack strategy. If you have too many attack cards, your deck becomes incoherent and you may not have enough defense. Make sure you build up your defense first before committing too many cards to offense. However, if you can't improve your defense before fighting an Elite enemy in World 1, then you should get an attack card that is better than Fighter. If you can't find any of the suggested cards below, you can take any card that does about 10 damage or more and remove it later in the game once once you have something better.

### Attack Strategy: Shield Bash
Deal damage equal to your Shield. You will want sources of Armored, permanent Resistance, and Shield cards with multiplying effects. This strategy works best when you have *Space Commander* or *RoboWitch [ROBOT]*.
Deal damage equal to your Shield. This is the safest strategy, because you can focus on building up massive shield to block every attack. Strength boosts are useless for this strategy, so you only need Resistance boosts. You will want sources of Armored, permanent Resistance, and Shield cards with multiplying effects. This strategy works best when you have *Space Commander* or *RoboWitch [ROBOT]*.
- **First choice**: *Alestar, Tranquility Defender [ANCIENT]* - Take multiple copies and start collecting ANCIENT cards. Try to get *Dhorion, Holy Sentinel [ANCIENT]* as well.
- **Second and third choice**: *Guardian of the Demons [DEMON]*, *Black Knight* - Take only one copy. I would avoid getting these until I know I will be using a Shield Bash strategy.
